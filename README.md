I chose to pull tweets from Washington state and Florida state because I was curious to see both two completely different political spots in the US as well as geographically.  After reviewing my results it was cool to see how florida was a bit more lively on twitter and had alot of posts about the day and just active things while seattle had a little less posts with more focus on seattle sports and jobs.
